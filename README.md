# Math Solver
Welcome to my small project, Math Solver, which is really just a collection of simple math functions and solvers of math problems.

## Functions
- Factorial calculator
- Greatest Common Divisor Calculator (Euclidean method)
- Fibonacci number generator

## Solvers
- Linear Diophantine Equation solver (solving equations of the form ax + by = c with constants a,b,c for integer solutions x,y)
> Why? Imagine you have two types of coins. This LDE solver can provide you a set of solutions, indicating all of the possible ways to produce a change of c.

## Future Project Goals
- Support solvers for higher level math equations (derivatives, integrals, etc.)
- Provide a simple and sleek GUI for users to enjoy while checking the answers to their math homework
